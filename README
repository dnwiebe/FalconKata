- INSTRUCTIONS FOR UBUNTU 14.04 -

Make sure check is installed:

$ sudo apt-get install check

In the base directory (the one containing src and tests), do this to build prod and tests and run the tests:

$ make all

The prod executable will be ./target/falconkata.  Pipe in one or more problems of the form:

<Roman numeral> + <Roman numeral>\n
<Roman numeral> - <Roman numeral>\n

Use only uppercase.  Make sure you have one or more whitespace characters surrounding the operator.

The output will be a sequence of Roman numerals, each on a line by itself, in the same order as the input problems.  If something is invalid about an input problem, its output will be a line containing the input problem prefixed by a #.

- INSTRUCTIONS FOR OTHER OPERATING SYSTEMS -

An obsolete operating system was deliberately specified for this kata. OS/X? Docker under a modern OS? Windows? Yer on yer own.
